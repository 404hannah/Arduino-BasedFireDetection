## Arduino-Based Fire Detection And Warning System Using Flame Sensor With LCD Monitoring
##### Digital Design Case Study

##### Description
Arduino- Based Fire Detection and warning system using Flame Sensor with LCD Monitoring project aims to detect the presence of fire with the help of a flame sensor and to process information, The entire system will be controlled by an Arduino microcontroller. Upon detecting the infrared wavelengths that flames emit, a signal will be transmitted to the LED which will flicker a red light and a buzzer that will sound to warn and alert anyone within the vicinity. Additionally, an LCD will show the fire alarm system's current status. The fire alarm system warns individuals automatically as a precaution.

##### Features
* Flame Detection
* LCD, Buzzer, and LED Warning
